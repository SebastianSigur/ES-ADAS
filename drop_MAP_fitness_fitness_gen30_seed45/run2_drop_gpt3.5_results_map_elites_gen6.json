By introducing a validation step that considers reasoning instead of just counting frequency, we can improve the robustness of the final answer.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Maintain multiple LLMAgentBase instances while ensuring that each one focuses on a distinct reasoning path.\n2. After collecting answers, introduce a validation mechanism that evaluates the reasoning quality of each answer.\n3.
