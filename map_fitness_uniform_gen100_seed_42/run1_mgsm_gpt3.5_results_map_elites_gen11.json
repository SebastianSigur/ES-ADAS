This will provide deeper exploration of the problem and allow the model to improve its answer based on feedback and reflection. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new architecture will consist of an initial reasoning phase followed by a feedback-driven iterative process that allows the agent to refine its answer. This approach will ensure that we leverage the strengths of LLMs through multiple iterations, leading to improved accuracy. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize an LLM agent for initial reasoning.\n2. Use a critic agent to evaluate the initial output and guide refinement.\n3. Implement a loop to allow for refining the answer based on feedback for a specified number of iterations.\n4. Each iteration will involve calling the reasoning agent again with updated inputs, including previous answers and feedback. \n5. Finally, return the best refined answer based on the iterations.",
