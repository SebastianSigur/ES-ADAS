        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the existing architecture, I propose a structure that emphasizes problem decomposition by initially analyzing the problem into discrete mathematical tasks. Following this, each task will be independently solved by dedicated agents, with a final synthesis phase to combine the results. This approach maintains a clear focus on the reasoning process, ensuring that each sub-task is tackled efficiently while optimizing performance through independent validations. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe design consists of an analysis phase to extract and detail mathematical components, a solving phase where each component is addressed by distinct agents, and a synthesis phase that compiles these results into a cohesive final answer. This multi-agent approach encourages diverse reasoning paths and improves accuracy through isolated computations, thereby enhancing the overall problem-solving capability.",
