This architecture will feature dedicated agents for extracting principles, calculating the number of cats based on dogs, and determining the total number of pets separately. The goal is to enhance clarity and accuracy while keeping the API call count low. \n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of a Principle Extraction Agent to analyze relationships, a Cats Calculation Agent for computing cat numbers, and a Total Calculation Agent to sum up the total pets, each functioning independently yet contributing to the overall answer.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create a Principle Extraction Agent to identify key relationships among pets.\n2. Develop a Cats Calculation Agent that will compute the number of cats from the extracted principles.\n3. Implement a Total Calculation Agent that will use results from the Cats Calculation Agent to compute the total number of pets effectively.",
