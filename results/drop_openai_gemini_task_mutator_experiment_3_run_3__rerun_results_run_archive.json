Your expertise in prompting strategies and existing literature is vital. Strive to enhance the defined performance metrics by suggesting uniquely intriguing agents. Carefully analyze the agents that have been identified and reflect on the insights, lessons, or foundations that can be gained from them. Embrace creativity in envisioning the next compelling agent to experiment with, and feel free to draw from related research papers or studies in different domains. Utilize knowledge from the archives and academic sources to develop a novel design for the next agentic system. THINK BEYOND THE NORM."
