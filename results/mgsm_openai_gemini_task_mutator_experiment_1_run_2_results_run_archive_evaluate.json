        "thought": "**Insights:**\nThe current architecture is built around a collaborative multi-agent system but lacks an adaptive mechanism that dynamically assigns roles based on agent performance. This could lead to inefficiencies, especially if less competent agents dominate the decision-making process. Dynamic role assignment would allow the system to optimize performance by ensuring that the most suitable agent handles a specific task.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will consist of specialized agents, each endowed with the ability to adaptively take on different roles (e.g., Principle Agent, Reasoning Agent, Critic Agent). A Supervisory Agent will evaluate the performance of each specialized agent and assign them roles based on their past effectiveness. This adaptive framework would allow for continuous improvement and optimal task handling while ensuring a robust feedback mechanism.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define specialized agents as before but integrate a Supervisory Agent to monitor and evaluate their performance.\n2. Implement dynamic role assignment based on performance metrics, allowing the system to adaptively assign roles for each task.\n3. Enhance feedback loops with structured critique prompts that reference specific parts of each answer to ensure constructive feedback.\n4. Collect and analyze feedback to continually improve each agent's effectiveness in subsequent tasks.",
