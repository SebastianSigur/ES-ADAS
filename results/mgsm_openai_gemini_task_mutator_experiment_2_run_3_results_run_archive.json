This architecture will consist of agents that generate independent solutions, critique each other\u2019s responses, and engage in a dynamic dialogue where they can ask curiosity-driven questions and suggest enhancements in a single interaction. By combining these tasks under one mechanism, we can streamline communication and enhance the overall effectiveness of the feedback process.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe 'Dynamic Feedback Dialogue' architecture aims to facilitate a richer exchange of ideas. Each agent will independently generate a solution, followed by a phase where they critique each other\u2019s work while simultaneously posing curiosity-driven questions and suggesting enhancements. This integrated approach will encourage collaborative problem-solving and create a more fluid interaction among agents.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize agents to generate independent solutions with reasoning.\n2. During the dialogue phase, each agent will critique a peer's solution, provide enhancements, and ask curiosity-driven questions in a single step.\n3. Collect the responses, critiques, enhancements, and questions for synthesis.\n4. The synthesizer will evaluate all inputs and generate the final answer.",
