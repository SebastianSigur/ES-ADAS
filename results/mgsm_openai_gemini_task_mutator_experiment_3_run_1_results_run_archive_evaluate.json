By allowing the feedback to come from various perspectives, we can simulate a more holistic approach to problem-solving that mirrors collaborative human efforts.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of a feedback network where multiple feedback agents provide diverse perspectives on the answers generated by the primary answer agents. This will allow mentees to refine their answers based on a wider array of insights and critique, enhancing the learning experience and fostering a more robust solution. The process will be iterative and will involve feedback consolidation to ensure coherent and productive updates to the answers.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. **Answer Generation:** Multiple LLM agents generate initial answers independently.\n2. **Diverse Feedback Collection:** Multiple feedback agents evaluate each answer and provide commentary.\n3. **Iterative Refinement:** Mentee agents refine their answers based on feedback from various sources.\n4. **Final Decision Making:** A final decision agent evaluates the refined answers and selects the most reliable response.",
