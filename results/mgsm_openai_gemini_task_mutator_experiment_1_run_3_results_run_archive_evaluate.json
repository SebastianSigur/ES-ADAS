This architecture emphasizes not just real-time interactions, but also dynamically adapting roles and strategies based on ongoing feedback and performance metrics. By allowing agents to assess their effectiveness and switch roles accordingly, the network can foster a more fluid and responsive problem-solving environment. Each agent will adapt not only their outputs but also their contributions based on how well they are performing in specific contexts.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of three main components: a 'Role Adaptation Agent' that monitors the contributions of agents and suggests role changes based on ongoing performance, a 'Solution Generation Agent' that focuses on creating detailed answers, and a 'Feedback Synthesizer' that compiles insights from critiques and discussions to enhance overall output. By integrating adaptability into the architecture, agents will be able to respond effectively to changing problem contexts and peer dynamics.",
