The new architecture will utilize a two-pronged approach: initially analyzing the problem for mathematical principles, followed by refining the answer based on feedback from previous attempts. This allows the agent to learn not just from its mistakes but also from understanding the fundamental concepts involved in the problem, leading to more effective solutions.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThis architecture will create a 'Contextual Learning Agent' that emphasizes the role of mathematical principles in solving problems. The agent will iterate over the solution process while incorporating feedback and contextual insights, leading to improved accuracy and understanding of mathematical concepts in problem-solving.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Begin with an initial reasoning phase that identifies and applies relevant mathematical principles.\n2. Implement a feedback mechanism that evaluates the answer and categorizes any mistakes.\n3. Integrate contextual learning that informs the next steps based on the principles identified in step 1.\n4. Finalize the answer based on a comprehensive understanding of both the principles and the feedback received, iterating as necessary.",
