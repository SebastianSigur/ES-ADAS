        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo address the shortcomings in the previous architecture, I propose a refined architecture that incorporates a more robust evaluation system that dynamically adjusts expert credibility based on historical performance, rather than just relying on correctness feedback. This will allow for a more nuanced understanding of expert contributions and better utilize their inputs over time. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture consists of multiple expert agents generating answers, alongside a validation agent that evaluates each output. Instead of simply marking outputs as correct or incorrect, this architecture will track expert performance history and adaptively adjust the influence of their responses in the synthesis process. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Create expert agents that generate responses based on the task information.\n2. Implement a validation agent that reviews each expert's output and provides feedback based on correctness and completeness.\n3. Maintain a dynamic credibility score for each expert, allowing the system to weigh contributions based on past performance.\n4. Synthesize outputs by considering validated responses, with higher credibility scores leading to greater influence in the final answer.",
