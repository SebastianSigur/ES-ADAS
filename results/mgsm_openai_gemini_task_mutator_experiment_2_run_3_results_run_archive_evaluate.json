This will allow for more efficient information flow and a clearer pathway to generating innovative solutions. By categorizing outputs from critiques into strengths and weaknesses, we can refine the enhancement suggestions, ensuring they are actionable and relevant. \n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture, named 'Integrated Collaborative Enhancement', will consist of agents generating independent solutions, followed by an interactive phase where they critique each other's responses, categorizing critiques and directly suggesting enhancements and alternatives based on those critiques. This integrated approach will maximize the effectiveness and creativity of the problem-solving process. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize agents to generate individual answers with reasoning. \n2. In the critique phase, agents will critique each other's answers, categorizing critiques into strengths and weaknesses while suggesting enhancements and alternative solutions based on these critiques. \n3. Collect all responses, critiques, enhancements, and alternatives for synthesis. \n4. The synthesizer will evaluate all contributions to provide the best final answer.",
