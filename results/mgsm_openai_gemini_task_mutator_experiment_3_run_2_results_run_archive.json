This architecture will focus on integrating dynamic contextual factors into the problem-solving process while allowing for adaptive iterative feedback. Unlike previous models, this architecture will systematically evaluate the context of each historical insight and its relevance to the current problem, emphasizing the significance of context in mathematical reasoning. The architecture will leverage contextual cues from previous iterations to refine the process of integrating feedback, ensuring that only relevant insights contribute meaningfully to the solution.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe agent will consist of an initial reasoning phase followed by adaptive contextual evaluation in iterative feedback loops. Each iteration will assess the relevance of historical insights and provide a refined answer based on contextually relevant learning.
