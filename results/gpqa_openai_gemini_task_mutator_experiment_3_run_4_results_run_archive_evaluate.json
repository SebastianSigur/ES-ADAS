This architecture will maintain the structure of critiques but streamline how they are aggregated and utilized in the refinement phase.

It consists of multiple expert agents generating initial answers, followed by a targeted discussion among them based on structured critiques. After discussing their feedback, each agent will refine their answers, leading to a consensus output that reflects collective reasoning.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize multiple expert agents to provide independent answers.\n2. Each agent generates an initial answer based on the task using a reasoning instruction.\n3. Implement structured critiques where agents provide feedback organized by specific categories (clarity, correctness, depth).\n4. Enable a focused discussion among agents about their critiques before refining their answers.\n5. Collect and aggregate the refined answers based on the collaborative discussions.\n6.
