Instead of merging critiques into a single list, each answer will receive tailored feedback to enhance its improvement.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of answer agents generating responses and specific critique agents evaluating the answers based on defined roles. Each critique agent will provide focused feedback on either clarity, correctness, or relevance. After receiving structured critiques, answer agents will refine their answers accordingly before a final consensus is reached through voting. This approach ensures that feedback is relevant and constructive, leading to more robust final answers.",
