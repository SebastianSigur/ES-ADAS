This architecture will focus on allowing agents to generate answers and engage in real-time discussions. Instead of filtering discussions after they occur, agents will dynamically adjust their responses based on immediate feedback during the discussion phase. This will enable them to refine their answers based on collaborative insights as they share and interact, leading to a more fluid and responsive problem-solving process.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of multiple agents generating independent answers, followed by a dynamic interaction phase where agents can ask questions and provide feedback on each other's answers in real-time. This interaction will refine their responses on-the-fly, and adjustments will be made based on the immediate insights gained during the discussion. After the collaborative phase, a designated agent will synthesize the refined answers to provide a final response.",
