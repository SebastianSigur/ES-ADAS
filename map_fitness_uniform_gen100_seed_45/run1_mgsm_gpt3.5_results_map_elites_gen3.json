This allows for a clearer and more cohesive reasoning process.\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe new approach involves using a single intelligent agent that analyzes the task, generates multiple reasoning paths, and selects the best answer based on that analysis, without repetitive routing calls. This provides a linear chain of thought while adhering to the constraints of API call limits.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use one LLM agent with a flexible instruction set that encompasses various possible methods to solve the task. \n2. Implement a clear sequence of calls to this agent, ensuring each call is well-defined and purposeful, thus adhering to the API call limits. \n3. Collect multiple reasoning outputs in a single pass and select the best answer based on aggregated insights.",
