After every round of feedback collection, the agents will adjust their instructions for the next iteration based on the critiques, leading to refined and accurate outputs with fewer API calls. \n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize specialized agents for principle extraction, algebra, and geometry. \n2. Each agent will analyze the task, generate initial answers, and provide reasoning. \n3. Collect feedback after each round and adjust subsequent instructions based on this feedback.\n4. Refine the outputs iteratively, ensuring that each agent's response is influenced by the previous round's feedback. \n5. Conclude with a decision agent that synthesizes the final outputs.",
