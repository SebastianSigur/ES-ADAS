        "thought": "**Insights:**\nTo enhance the architecture, I propose integrating iterative refinement that allows specialized agents to improve their solutions through multiple rounds of feedback rather than a single evaluation. This iterative approach aims to refine the answers progressively, leading to a more accurate final outcome.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture will consist of a principle extraction agent followed by specialized agents performing an iterative process. They will analyze the problem using extracted principles, gather feedback, and refine their answers across several rounds to enhance clarity and accuracy.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define instructions for the principle extraction agent.\n2. Instantiate specialized agents that will analyze the problem based on the principles.\n3. Allow agents to generate initial responses.\n4. Collect feedback based on these responses.\n5. Implement a loop for a specified number of iterations to refine the answers with updated feedback from each round.\n6. Conclude with a final decision based on the refined outputs.",
