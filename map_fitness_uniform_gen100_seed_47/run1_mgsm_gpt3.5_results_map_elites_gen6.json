By combining their outputs, we can achieve a final solution that is reflective of multiple mathematical strategies. \n**Implementation:**\n1. Define distinct instructions for each specialized agent, focusing on their area of expertise.\n2. Create instances of specialized agents to generate unique reasoning paths.\n3. Aggregate the outputs from these specialized agents to form a consensus answer, ensuring that we leverage the strengths of each domain.\n4.
