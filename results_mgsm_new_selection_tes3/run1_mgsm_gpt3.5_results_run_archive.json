The reasoning agent will incorporate its own reasoning mechanisms to derive a solution based on the principles, thereby maintaining a multi-agent style while minimizing API calls.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Create a single agent for extracting principles from the task, ensuring that it effectively captures the relevant mathematical concepts. \n2. Use another agent for the reasoning process, allowing it to integrate the principles and solve the task efficiently.\n3.
