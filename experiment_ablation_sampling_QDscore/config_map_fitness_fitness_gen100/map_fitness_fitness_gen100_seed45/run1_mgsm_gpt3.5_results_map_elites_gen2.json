Instead of dynamically routing to multiple agents, we can keep a fixed set of experts that work collaboratively and iteratively refine their outputs via a voting mechanism. This can help maintain diversity in responses while reducing the number of API calls.\n**Overall Idea:**\nImplement a fixed group of agents that receive the initial problem statement and work concurrently, followed by a voting mechanism to select the best response. This way, we maintain diversity in reasoning without excessive API calls. The agents will each approach the problem but avoid unnecessary instantiation overheads, thus improving efficiency.",
