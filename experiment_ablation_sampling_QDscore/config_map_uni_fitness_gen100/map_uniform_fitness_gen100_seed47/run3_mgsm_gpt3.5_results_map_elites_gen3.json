This will allow for a more robust and diverse output, catering to the strengths of each agent while mitigating individual biases or errors.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe revised architecture will utilize multiple specialized agents as in the previous version, but it will aggregate their answers through a voting mechanism to determine the most accurate final answer. This participatory approach will increase the overall effectiveness and reliability of the solution.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Define sub-task instructions for each specialized agent.\n2. Instantiate each agent uniquely to ensure diverse outputs.\n3. After collecting all initial responses, utilize a voting mechanism to aggregate answers for the final decision-making process.\n4.
